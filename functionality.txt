Consider a Banking organization that provides a live chat facility as a customer care
service.
For simplicity, let’s assume that we have a single customer care representative at a time
who is handling simultaneous queries from multiple clients and replying over the chat.
Design such a chat application over connection­oriented protocol.
So multiple clients can connect to the representative/server and exchange messages
with it. The server may receive all messages over a single window but a reply from the
server must reach the respective client only, depending on order of message(query)
arrival. Example, if client 1’s query/message came first and before server could reply it
has another query from client 2. So first reply from server corresponds to client 1 and
the second reply from server corresponds to client 2.
